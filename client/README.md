# This app allows businesses to keep track of inventory and unit costs, both for products and supplies used in manufacturing.

It uses a recursive SQL query to calculate average unit cost through time as supplies are purchased and used in the manufacturing of the products which the company ultimately sells to consumers.

It is inspired in internal solutions developed at https://usechimp.com.
